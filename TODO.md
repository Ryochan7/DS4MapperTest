## TODO

* Test adding Logging to project
* Possibly allow virtual Touchpad buttons in Touchpad actions
* ~~Try to figure out why Mapper::GenerateMouseEventFiltered is used the way it is.  
Behavior keeps GyroMouse and FlickStick from working together~~
* Add profile specific settings outside actions. (Stick deflection gyro trigger deadzone)
* ~~Test partial feedback activation for StickCircular~~
* Experiment further with gyro Jitter Compensation threshold value
* Implement 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless BT and Dongle support. IIRC, it only works wired currently
* Add presets for gyro smoothing values
* Possibly look into exposing gyro coordinates in degrees per second (dps) rather  
than raw units
